**Power BI Eskom Predict**
- In this predict, I used Eskom data to build an informative dashboard using Microsoft Power BI.
- The dashboard, with its underlying reports, will be used to derive insight into the current South African energy crisis. 
- I was tasked to properly source the data and set up the relationships in the Capacity and Efficiency dashboard. 
- Thereafter I had to clean the data to get it in a workable format. To do this, I had to replace the empty and null value columns with the column average. 
- Using Power BI slicers and filters I was able to draw correlations between station attributes, and explore and analyse this dataset in-depth.
