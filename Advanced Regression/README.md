**Machine Learning Sprint**

- Included in this folder is the Machine Learning predict and code challenges throughout the Explore Academy  

*Linear Regression*

- I tasked with building a model for the government of Spain to predict the shortfall between energy generated by fossil fuels and energy generated with
renewable sources. 
- My challenge for this task will be to compete in your first Kaggle competition by training a regression model to predict three-hourly
demand shortfall.

*Logistic Regression*
- South Africa is a multicultural society that is characterised by its rich linguistic diversity. Language is an indispensable tool that can be used to deepen democracy and also contribute to the social, cultural, intellectual, economic and political life of the South African society. 
- With such a multilingual population, it is only obvious that our systems and devices also communicate in multi-languages.
- My challenge for this sprint will be to compete in a Kaggle competition by training a classification model to predict in which South African language a piece of text is written in.
