**Machine Learning Course**

- Included in this folder is the Machine Learning predict and code challenges throughout the Explore Academy  

*Linear Regression*

- I tasked with building a model for the government of Spain to predict the shortfall between energy generated by fossil fuels and energy generated with
renewable sources. 

*Logistic Regression*
- Kaggle, according to their website, allows users to “discover and publish their own data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment; work with other data scientists; and enter competitions to solve
data science challenges.”
- My challenge for this sprint will be to compete in a Kaggle competition by training a classification model to predict in which South African language a piece of text is written in.
- South Africa is a multicultural society that is characterised by its rich linguistic diversity. Language is an indispensable tool that can be used to deepen democracy and also contribute to the social, cultural, intellectual, economic and
political life of the South African society. 
- With such a multilingual population, it is only obvious that our systems and devices also communicate in multi-languages.
